### 1 and 2. (Sept 3rd and 10th) [Numerical Computing](Lectures/Lecture-IEEE.pdf) ([annotated](Lectures/Lecture-IEEE.annotated.pdf))

In the main textbook, this is covered in chapters 5 and 6. I suggest
instead reading part I (chapters 1-4) in the [textbook by O'Leary](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/book/10.1137/9780898717723). 

For more information consult chapter 1 in the book by Driscoll or chapter I in [notes by Jonathan Goodman](http://www.cs.nyu.edu/courses/spring09/G22.2112-001/book/SourcesOfError.chapter.pdf)

Here are some MATLAB scripts used as examples in the lecture notes: [Fibbonaci](Matlab/fibb.m), [integral](Matlab/Integral.m),  [vectorization](Matlab/vect.m), harmonic sum [double precision](Matlab/harmonic.m) and [single precision](Matlab/harmonicSP.m). 
Also an example solution to the example homework problem on finite difference first derivative  in [double precision](Matlab/FirstDeriv.m) and [single precision](Matlab/FirstDerivSP.m).

Here is a printout of the the Maple script studying [propagated error in HW1 problem 2](Homeworks/SStability-pi.pdf).

### 1 and 2. (Sept 17th and 24th) [Solving Linear Systems](Lectures/Lecture-LinearSystems.pdf) ([annotated](Lectures/Lecture-LinearSystems.annotated.pdf))

Please go through Section 1 (Review of Linear Algebra) **on your own** ahead of class.

For dense square and overdetermined
systems see chapter 7 in the main textbook, while for sparse matrices see 12.2
in the textbook. For a more in-depth overview of sparse solvers see
chapters 27 (direct) or 28 (iterative) in the [textbook by O'Leary](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/book/10.1137/9780898717723).

For a more mathematical review of linear algebra consult 
[part 1 of notes by Jonathan Goodman](http://www.cs.nyu.edu/courses/spring09/G22.2112-001/book/LinearAlgebra1.chapter.pdf), 
and for a more in-depth discussion on performance consult [part 2 of notes by Jonathan Goodman](http://www.cs.nyu.edu/courses/spring09/G22.2112-001/book/LinearAlgebra2.chapter.pdf)

Here is the MATLAB code [MyLU.m](Matlab/MyLU.m).
