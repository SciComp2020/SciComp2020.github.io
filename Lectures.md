###1 and 2. (Sept 3rd and 10th) [Numerical Computing](Lectures/Lecture-IEEE.handout.pdf)

In the main textbook, this is covered in chapters 5 and 6. I suggest
instead reading part I (chapters 1-4) in the [textbook by O'Leary](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/book/10.1137/9780898717723). 

For more information consult chapter 1 in the book by Driscoll. For additional reading look at chapter I in [notes by Jonathan Goodman](http://www.cs.nyu.edu/courses/spring09/G22.2112-001/book/SourcesOfError.chapter.pdf)

Here are some MATLAB scripts used as examples in the lecture notes: [Fibbonaci](Matlab/fibb.m), [integral](Matlab/Integral.m),  [vectorization](Matlab/vect.m), harmonic sum [double precision](Matlab/harmonic.m) and [single precision](Matlab/harmonicSP.m). 
Also an example solution to the example homework problem on finite difference first derivative  in [double precision](Matlab/FirstDeriv.m) and [single precision](Matlab/FirstDerivSP.m)
