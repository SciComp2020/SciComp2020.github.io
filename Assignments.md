Please read the [instructions for submitting homeworks](Homeworks.html) and follow them when preparing and submitting the homework assignments.

### 1. (Due Sept 20th) [Numerical Computing](Assignments/Homework-IEEE.pdf)

Take a look at the [sample solution](Assignments/SolutionSample.pdf) to the example homework problem on finite difference first derivative in [double precision](Matlab/FirstDeriv.m) and [single precision](Matlab/FirstDerivSP.m), and follow this as an example of what a stellar solution would look like.

### 2. (Due Oct 4th) [Linear Systems](Assignments/Homework-LinearSystems.pdf)

Problem 1 and 3 can be solved based on material covered in the third lecture (LU factorization), and problem 2 after the fourth lecture (overdetermined linear systems).

Here is [code](Matlab/matinv.m) to compute the matrix inverse (taken from  [matrixlab](http://www.matrixlab-examples.com/matrix-inversion.html)). Try this code instead of the built-in function inv and compare.

### 3. (Due Oct 18th) [Eigen and Singular Values](Assignments/Homework-Eigenvalues.pdf)

Problem 1 is a continuation of problem 1 from the second homework. Problem 2 is hopefully fun and playfull and there are no precise answers. It is meant to get you to play with some "real world" data and see how PCA can reveal things in data but not always in an obvious way.
