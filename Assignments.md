Please read the [instructions for submitting homeworks](Homeworks.html) and follow them when preparing and submitting the homework assignments.

### 1. (Due Sept 20th) [Numerical Computing](Assignments/Homework-IEEE.pdf)

Take a look at the [sample solution](Assignments/SolutionSample.pdf) to the example homework problem on finite difference first derivative in [double precision](Matlab/FirstDeriv.m) and [single precision](Matlab/FirstDerivSP.m), and follow this as an example of what a stellar solution would look like.

### 2. (Due Oct 4th) [Linear Systems](Assignments/Homework-LinearSystems.pdf)

Problem 1 and 3 can be solved based on material covered in the third lecture (LU factorization), and problem 2 after the fourth lecture (overdetermined linear systems).
