## Scientific Computing (MATH-GA.2043/CSCI-GA.2112)

This class will be online on zoom (scheduled via NYU classes) during the Fall of 2019, **Thursdays 5:10pm-7pm**.
An additional session will be scheduled for group work (TBD). 
We will use [CampusWire](https://campuswire.com/) for a communication board for group work and questions (signup link will be sent via NYU Classes).

The class content will be very similar to that from [Fall 2019](https://cims.nyu.edu/~donev/Teaching/SciComp-Fall2019/), so consult that if deciding whether to take this class.
