 <h3>Course description</h3>
 <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: italic;">This
     course is a graduate-level introduction to practical introduction
     to computational problem solving, including both mathematical
     analysis of numerical algorithms (numerical analysis) and
     practical problem solving. This is not a programming course but
     programming in homework projects with Matlab or
     numerical/scientific Python is an important part of the course
     work.</span></p>
 <p>3 points per term</p>
 <p>Topics covered include:<span style="font-style: italic;"><br />
   </span></p>
 <ul>
   <li>floating point arithmetic, conditioning and stability</li>
   <li>direct methods for systems of linear equations</li>
   <li>matrix eigenvalue problems and SVD decomposition</li>
   <li>numerical interpolation, differentiation and integration</li>
   <li>nonlinear systems of equations and unconstrained optimization</li>
   <li>Fourier and wavelet transforms</li>
   <li>ordinary and partial differential equations</li>
   <li>Monte Carlo methods.</li>
 </ul>
 All materials related to this course, including lecture notes,
 homeworks, schedule, etc., will be posted here. Homework assignments
 submission and the exams will be handled via NYU Classes. Videos of my lectures
 as well as some example solutions of assignments will also be posted
 there.<br />


<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">A solid background (undergraduate
   level) in multivariate calculus and linear algebra. Experience with
   writing computer programs (in Matlab, Python with numpy, Julia or other
   high-level language) is strongly recommended as homework assignments
   will involve programming from the start and you will be expected to
   catch up on your own (summer break is a good time to learn
   programming!).</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">Prior knowledge of Matlab is not
   required, but it will be used as the main language for the course
   right away from the start so you will need to catch up on your own.
   If you have experience with other languages (Fortran, C, C++,
   Python), Matlab will be easy to learn and use, and comes with a
   great help facility. Please look at some of the "Additional
   Readings" above for programming guides.</p>
 
 <h4>Computing</h4>
 <div style="text-align: justify;"> Computing on your own will form an
   essential part of the learning process and your own applied
   mathematics training. Matlab is available to all NYU students via
   our <a href="https://www.nyu.edu/life/information-technology/getting-started/software/matlab.html">ITS
     software service</a>. You can install it on your personal laptop
   without a charge.</div>
 <div style="text-align: justify;"><br />
 </div>
 <div style="text-align: justify;">
   You are encouraged to submit reports as PDFs produced using LaTex
   (latex), as a good practice in learning how to use mathematical
   typesetting software for future papers and thesis reports. I
   recommend trying out the <a href="http://www.lyx.org/">LyX word
     processor</a> as a front-end GUI to LaTex, especially if you are
   new to LaTex.<br />
   <br />
   Also see these <a href="http://www.cs.nyu.edu/courses/spring09/G22.2112-001/refs.html">
     resources listed by my colleague David Bindell</a>. In particular,
   some <a href="http://www.cs.nyu.edu/courses/spring09/G22.2112-001/coding.html">
     coding advice</a> that may be useful in general.<br />
 </div>

 <h4>Textbook(s)</h4>
 <div style="text-align: justify;"> For lectures, I will use my own
   lecture slides (complemented by real-time tablet annotation) that will be posted
   here. I will not follow any specific textbook per se, however, you
   will need to complement the lectures and my slides with additional
   reading depending on your background. This will not only give you a broader perspective but it
   will also give you a <i>different perspective</i>, which is very
   important.<br />
   <br />
   As the <strong>primary textbook</strong> that I will point you to
   for additional reading, I recommend <a href="http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9763.html">Numerical
     Methods: Design, Analysis, and Computer Implementation of
     Algorithms</a> by Anne Greenbaum &amp; Timothy P. Chartier
   (library call number QA297.G15 2012). This book is available to you
   freely in <a href="https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/nyulibrary-ebooks/detail.action?docID=867854">electronic
     format</a> via NYU's library (<a href="http://bobcat.library.nyu.edu/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=nyu_aleph006178957&amp;context=L&amp;vid=NYU&amp;search_scope=all&amp;isFrbr=true&amp;tab=all&amp;lang=en_US">permalink</a>).
   Codes can be found at the <a href="http://academics.davidson.edu/math/chartier/Numerical/">author's
     website</a>.<br />
   <br />
   A <strong>secondary optional textbook</strong> is <span dir="auto"><a
       href="https://my.siam.org/Store/Product/viewproduct/?ProductId=29215528">Fundamentals
       of numerical computation</a> by Tobin Driscoll (</span><span dir="auto"><span
       dir="auto"><span dir="auto">QA297.D75 2018)</span></span>, see <a
       href="https://github.com/tobydriscoll/fnc-extras">additional
       resources</a> including codes/slides in Matlab/Julia/Python.
     This book is not available freely but an electronic copy can be
     purchased via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Tobin_A_Driscoll_Fundamentals_of_Numerical_Computa?id=W9JEDwAAQBAJ&amp;hl=en_US">google
       play</a> -- if you wish to purchase a hard copy use this <a href="DriscollBraunOT154_adoptiondicflyer.pdf">20%
       discount flier</a>. This textbook is very applied and hands on
     with Matlab and more elementary in some respects.</span></div>

 <h4>Additional Resources</h4>
 <div style="text-align: justify;"> A more advanced text that is not a
   first textbook on numerical methods but has very nice case studies
   demonstrating applications of scientific computing in various
   disciplines can be found in the book <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/%7Eoleary/SCCS/">Scientific
     Computing with Case Studies</a> by Dianne P. O'Leary (library call
   number QA401.O44 2009), also available freely to you in <a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/book/10.1137/9780898717723">PDF
     format</a>. Additional case studies can be found <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/%7Eoleary/SCCS/supp/index.html">here</a>.<br />
   <br />
   Some of the lectures will be more closely based on a draft of an
   upcoming book <span style="font-style: italic;">Principles of
     Scientific Computing</span> by my colleagues Jonathan Goodman and
   David Bindel, to be found here as <a href="http://www.cs.nyu.edu/courses/spring09/G22.2112-001/book/book.pdf">
     one PDF</a> or as <a href="http://www.cs.nyu.edu/courses/spring09/G22.2112-001/lectures.html">
     individual chapters</a>. <br />
   <br />
   There are many free online materials that can be consulted as
   additional reading, depending on your background and interests. Here
   are some suggestions (more may be added as the course progresses)
   that you have special access to through the NYU/Courant library:<br />
