 <h3>Course description</h3>
 <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: italic;">This
     course is a graduate-level introduction to practical introduction
     to computational problem solving, including both mathematical
     analysis of numerical algorithms (numerical analysis) and
     practical problem solving. This is not a programming course but
     programming in homework projects with Matlab or
     numerical/scientific Python is an important part of the course
     work.</span></p>
 <p>3 points per term</p>
 <p>Topics covered include:<span style="font-style: italic;"><br />
   </span></p>
 <ul>
   <li>floating point arithmetic, conditioning and stability</li>
   <li>direct methods for systems of linear equations</li>
   <li>matrix eigenvalue problems and SVD decomposition</li>
   <li>numerical interpolation, differentiation and integration</li>
   <li>nonlinear systems of equations and unconstrained optimization</li>
   <li>Fourier and wavelet transforms</li>
   <li>ordinary and partial differential equations</li>
   <li>Monte Carlo methods.</li>
 </ul>
 All materials related to this course, including lecture notes,
 homeworks, schedule, etc., will be posted here. Homework assignments
 submission and the exams will be handled via NYU Classes. Videos of my lectures
 as well as some example solutions of assignments will also be posted
 there.<br />


<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">A solid background (undergraduate
   level) in multivariate calculus and linear algebra. Experience with
   writing computer programs (in Matlab, Python with numpy, Julia or other
   high-level language) is strongly recommended as homework assignments
   will involve programming from the start and you will be expected to
   catch up on your own (summer break is a good time to learn
   programming!).</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">Prior knowledge of Matlab is not
   required, but it will be used as the main language for the course
   right away from the start so you will need to catch up on your own.
   If you have experience with other languages (Fortran, C, C++,
   Python), Matlab will be easy to learn and use, and comes with a
   great help facility. Please look at some of the "Additional
   Readings" above for programming guides.</p>
 
 <h4>Computing</h4>
 <div style="text-align: justify;"> Computing on your own will form an
   essential part of the learning process and your own applied
   mathematics training. Matlab is available to all NYU students via
   our <a href="https://www.nyu.edu/life/information-technology/getting-started/software/matlab.html">ITS
     software service</a>. You can install it on your personal laptop
   without a charge.</div>

 </div>
 <div style="text-align: justify;">
   You are encouraged to submit reports as PDFs produced using LaTex
   (latex), as a good practice in learning how to use mathematical
   typesetting software for future papers and thesis reports. I
   recommend trying out the <a href="http://www.lyx.org/">LyX word
     processor</a> as a front-end GUI to LaTex, especially if you are
   new to LaTex.<br />

   some <a href="http://www.cs.nyu.edu/courses/spring09/G22.2112-001/coding.html">
     coding advice</a> that may be useful in general.<br />
